### Day 4: December, 25, 2017

### Day 1: December, 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I used my Design and Analysis of Algorithm classes notes to optimize my Algorithm. It took 5 tries to finally get and optimal working Algorithm. Algorithm I wrote simply convert dataset from db to data for graph

**Thoughts:** It was fun to see my Algorithm fail and making it work better. I found flaws in my own codes and it was great.
